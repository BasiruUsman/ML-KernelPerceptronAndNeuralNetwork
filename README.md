# ML-KernelPerceptronAndNeuralNetwork
The aim of this project is to implement two supervised classification machine learning algorithms namely; SVM and Decision Tree. The algorithms are implemented on the famous mnist scaled datasets with relatively large number of features. In all the three algorithms the test error is reported.
# Algorithms and Packages
Decison Tree and  Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use R-packages “libsvm” and “optimbase”.
