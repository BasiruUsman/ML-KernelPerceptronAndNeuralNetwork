# ML-KernelPerceptronAndNeuralNetwork
The aim of this project is to implement two supervised classification machine learning algorithms namely; SVM and Decision Tree. We are going to implement NN algorithm is two different ways. The algorithms are implemented on the famous mnist scaled datasets with relatively large number of features. In all the three algorithms the test error is reported.
# Algorithms and Packages
Decison Tree and  Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use R-packages “libsvm” and “optimbase”.
